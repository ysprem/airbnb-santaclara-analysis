# airbnb-santaclara-analysis
In this repo, I am going to host all the code related to analysis of Airbnb data for Santa Clara county, California and answer some interesting questions using the data.

I have detailed my findings in a blog post which can seen here: https://premys.medium.com/a-look-into-santa-clara-county-airbnb-data-fc8117ad7339

# Installations
I used Google Colab to run this analysis. It is a Jupyter notebook hosted on Google Cloud, ensuring that there is no need to run anything on a local machine, since everything is stored and run in the cloud. One can proceed to https://colab.sandbox.google.com/ to get started.

As a part of the analysis in Python, I used pandas, numpy, seaborn and pandasql to do the data wrangling. I also uploaded the csv files onto Google Drive first and loaded files into my Jupyter notebook from Google Drive.

# Project motivation
I wanted to look at Airbnb data as it has interesting real world implications related to tourism, travel and housing availability. I wanted to look at 5 interesting business questions about the data and understand what it would mean

# File descriptions
There are 2 files used for the analysis here. I have included them in the repo.
listings.csv contains all the metadata related to listings on Airbnb for Santa Clara county.
reviews.csv contains all the listing ids along with the review timestamp.
